# 🔧 Persistence and Logout Fixes

## 🔍 Issues Fixed

### 1. Logout Infinite Loop ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Clicking logout in the dashboard was causing an infinite loading loop
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Incomplete token cleanup during logout
  - Race condition with auth state listener
  - Insufficient localStorage/sessionStorage clearing
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced logout function with comprehensive token cleanup
  - Added proper isLoggingOutRef flag handling
  - Improved timing with increased delay before state reset
  - Complete clearing of ALL Supabase-related storage items

### 2. Data Persistence Issues ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: User preferences and settings weren't being saved properly
- **Root Cause**:
  - Lack of error handling for non-existent users
  - Theme changes not being properly saved to database
  - No data synchronization between local storage and database
- **Solution**:
  - Complete rewrite of userService for robust persistence
  - Improved error handling for database operations
  - Immediate localStorage updates with background database saves
  - Added data synchronization system

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Logout System Enhancements

```typescript
// Enhanced token cleanup
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.startsWith('sb-') || key.includes('supabase')) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
});

// Proper flag handling to prevent race conditions
isLoggingOutRef.current = true;
// ...logout operations...
setTimeout(() => {
  isLoggingOutRef.current = false;
}, 500);

// Auth listener protection
if (isLoggingOutRef.current) {
  console.log('🚫 Ignoring auth change during logout');
  return;
}
```

### Data Persistence Enhancements

```typescript
// Enhanced theme persistence
async updateTheme(userId: string, theme: string) {
  // Save immediately to localStorage for instant feedback
  localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
  
  // Trigger theme change event
  window.dispatchEvent(new StorageEvent('storage', {
    key: 'theme',
    newValue: theme,
    oldValue: localStorage.getItem('theme')
  }));
  
  // Save to database in background
  // ...database operations...
}

// Proper error handling with fallbacks
if (error) {
  // If user doesn't exist yet, create a new profile
  if (error.code === 'PGRST116') {
    return this.updateProfile(userId, {
      preferences: updatedPreferences
    });
  }
  throw error;
}
```

### ThemeContext Integration

```typescript
// Integration with auth system
const setTheme = useCallback((theme: ThemeName) => {
  setCurrentThemeState(theme);
  localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
  
  // If user is logged in, save theme preference to their profile
  if (auth?.currentUser?.id) {
    auth.updateUserTheme(auth.currentUser.id, theme)
      .catch(error => console.error('Failed to save theme to user profile:', error));
  }
}, [auth]);
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Improved Logout Flow
1. User clicks logout button
2. isLoggingOutRef flag is set to prevent race conditions
3. User state is immediately cleared
4. ALL localStorage and sessionStorage Supabase items are removed
5. Supabase auth.signOut is called with global scope
6. After a delay to ensure all operations complete, loading state is reset
7. User is redirected to landing page

### Enhanced Data Persistence
1. When user logs in, their profile is loaded and synced with localStorage
2. When user changes theme, it's immediately saved to localStorage for instant feedback
3. Theme is also saved to the database in the background
4. If database save fails, local storage still works for current session
5. User preferences are properly persisted across sessions and devices
6. If a user doesn't exist in the database, a new profile is created automatically

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Logout
1. Login to your account
2. Click the logout button in the dashboard
3. ✅ You should be immediately logged out and redirected to landing page
4. ✅ If you refresh the page, you should remain logged out
5. ✅ No infinite loading should occur

### Test Theme Persistence
1. Login to your account
2. Change theme in settings
3. ✅ Theme should change immediately
4. ✅ Logout and log back in
5. ✅ Your theme preference should be restored
6. ✅ Change theme again, then check another device - theme should sync

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive data syncing for other user preferences
- Implement offline support with background sync when online
- Add conflict resolution for multi-device edits
- Enhance error recovery with automatic retry mechanisms

## 🔄 How to Keep Data in Sync

The system now automatically syncs data between the database and local storage:

1. On login: `syncUserData` retrieves and applies all user preferences
2. On theme change: Theme is saved to both localStorage and the database
3. On preference update: All preferences are merged and saved properly
4. On logout: User data is properly cleared to prevent stale data

No additional action is required to keep data in sync - it happens automatically!
