# Preloader Component Documentation

## Overview
The Preloader component displays an animated loading screen while the Horafly AI Voice Calling application initializes. It features a sophisticated atomic-inspired animation with theme integration, creating an engaging visual experience that adapts to the user's selected theme.

## Component Structure

### Lines 1-10: Imports and Setup
- **React**: Core React functionality for component rendering
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animation library for smooth, physics-based animations
- **useTheme Hook**: Access to the current theme colors and styling system

### Lines 11-30: Background and Container
- **Full-Screen Container**: Fixed positioning covering the entire viewport with high z-index
- **Theme-Aware Background**: Uses the current theme's primary background color
- **Animated Particles**: 15 floating particles that move randomly across the screen
- **Particle Styling**: Uses theme's goldPrimary color with opacity for subtle background movement

### Lines 31-65: Central Nucleus Animation
- **Main Nucleus**: Large central orb (20x20) with theme-based gradient background
- **Pulsing Animation**: Smooth scale animation from 1 to 1.15 and back with 2.5-second duration
- **Dynamic Glow Effect**: Box-shadow animation using theme colors with varying intensity
- **Inner Glow**: Smaller inner circle using theme's textPrimary color for depth

### Lines 66-120: Electron Orbit System
- **Three Orbit Rings**: Concentric circles at increasing radii (70px, 105px, 140px)
- **Orbit Paths**: Visible ring borders using theme's goldPrimary color with transparency
- **Ring Rotation**: Each ring rotates at different speeds (10s, 12.4s, 14.8s)
- **Multiple Electrons**: Each ring contains 2-4 electrons (ringIndex + 2)
- **Electron Movement**: Circular motion around orbit paths with staggered timing
- **Electron Trails**: Pulsing trail effects that scale and fade for visual impact

### Lines 121-155: Energy Wave Effects
- **Three Energy Waves**: Expanding circular waves at different sizes
- **Wave Rotation**: Counter-rotating waves at varying speeds (10s, 13s, 16s)
- **Pulsing Borders**: Scale and opacity animations for breathing effect
- **Theme Integration**: Wave colors use theme's goldPrimary with transparency
- **Staggered Timing**: Delayed animations create layered wave effects

### Lines 156-200: Loading Text and Indicators
- **Main Title**: "Horafly AI Platform" with theme-based text color
- **Title Animation**: Gentle opacity pulsing with 2.5-second duration
- **Loading Dots**: Three animated dots with staggered scaling effects
- **Status Text**: "Initializing AI systems..." with theme-based accent color
- **Entrance Animation**: Slide-up animation with 0.8-second delay for text elements

### Lines 201-240: Corner Decorations
- **Four Corner Elements**: Decorative animated shapes in each corner
- **Varied Animations**: Different rotation speeds and directions for visual interest
- **Size Variation**: Different sizes (10px, 8px, 6px, 12px) for balanced composition
- **Theme Colors**: Uses goldPrimary, goldSecondary, and goldMuted with transparency

### Lines 241-280: Floating Geometric Shapes
- **Two Floating Elements**: Additional animated shapes for enhanced visual appeal
- **Complex Motion**: Combined translation and rotation animations
- **Asymmetric Placement**: Positioned at 1/4 and 3/4 screen positions
- **Long Duration**: 8-10 second animation cycles for subtle movement
- **Theme Integration**: Uses theme's gold color variants with transparency

## Animation Features

### Physics-Based Motion
- **Smooth Easing**: Uses easeInOut for natural-feeling animations
- **Infinite Loops**: All animations repeat infinitely for continuous motion
- **Staggered Timing**: Delayed starts create complex, layered animation patterns
- **Variable Speeds**: Different elements animate at different rates for visual depth

### Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced Particle Count**: Limited to 15 particles to maintain smooth performance
- **Efficient Transforms**: Uses CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
- **Optimized Durations**: Balanced animation speeds for smooth rendering
- **Conditional Rendering**: Window size checks prevent errors during SSR

## Theme Integration

### Dynamic Color System
- **Background Adaptation**: Uses theme's primary gradient for full-screen background
- **Accent Colors**: All animated elements use theme's gold color palette
- **Text Styling**: Typography adapts to theme's text color hierarchy
- **Transparency Effects**: Consistent opacity levels across theme variants

### Multi-Theme Support
- **Midnight Theme**: Warm cream accents on dark background
- **Ocean Theme**: Cyan and blue accents with ocean-inspired colors
- **Forest Theme**: Green accents with natural, calming tones
- **Sunset Theme**: Orange and amber accents with warm sunset colors
- **Royal Theme**: Purple accents with elegant, regal appearance

## Visual Hierarchy

### Layered Composition
1. **Background Layer**: Animated particles and theme background
2. **Energy Waves**: Large, subtle circular waves for depth
3. **Orbit System**: Main atomic structure with rotating elements
4. **Central Nucleus**: Primary focal point with strongest animation
5. **UI Elements**: Text and corner decorations on top layer

### Focal Point Design
- **Central Emphasis**: Largest and most animated element draws attention
- **Radial Layout**: Elements arranged in concentric circles from center
- **Size Progression**: Elements get smaller as they move away from center
- **Color Intensity**: Strongest colors at center, fading toward edges

## Responsive Behavior

### Screen Size Adaptation
- **Viewport Awareness**: Particle movement adapts to screen dimensions
- **Proportional Scaling**: All elements maintain proportions across devices
- **Safe Positioning**: Corner elements positioned safely within viewport
- **Performance Scaling**: Animation complexity remains consistent across devices

### Loading States
- **Immediate Display**: Shows instantly while application loads
- **Smooth Transitions**: Prepares for seamless transition to main app
- **Theme Persistence**: Maintains selected theme throughout loading process
- **State Management**: Properly handles theme context during initialization

This Preloader component creates an engaging, professional loading experience that reinforces the Horafly brand while providing visual feedback during application startup. The atomic-inspired design metaphorically represents the AI technology powering the platform, while the theme integration ensures a consistent user experience from the very first interaction.
