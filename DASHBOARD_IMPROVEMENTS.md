# Dashboard Component Improvements

## Overview
The Dashboard component has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive dummy data, improved styling, and better user experience. This document outlines all the improvements made.

## 🔧 Technical Fixes

### TypeScript Errors Fixed
- **Fixed speakers state type error**: Changed `useState([])` to `useState<string[]>([])` to properly type the speakers array
- **Added missing imports**: Added `Star` and `MapPin` icons from lucide-react
- **Cleaned up unused imports**: Removed `Trash2`, `activeSubTab`, `setActiveSubTab`, and `transcriptionFile` to resolve ESLint warnings

### PostCSS Configuration Fixed
- **Downgraded Tailwind CSS**: Changed from v4.1.7 to v3.4.0 for compatibility
- **Updated PostCSS config**: Used object format instead of array format for plugins
- **Resolved compilation errors**: Fixed the "tailwindcss directly as PostCSS plugin" error
